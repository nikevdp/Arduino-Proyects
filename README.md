📟 Arduino & ESP32 – Learning Repository

This repository contains all my Arduino and ESP32 projects and experiments, ranging from very basic examples to more advanced implementations.

The goal is to document my learning process step by step, starting with simple exercises — such as turning on an LED using a button — and gradually progressing toward more complex projects involving hardware interaction, embedded logic, and system control.

🔧 What you’ll find here

Basic electronics and microcontroller exercises

GPIO usage: buttons, LEDs, resistors, and common modules

Experiments and mini-projects using ESP32

Code focused on understanding how and why things work, not just making them work

🎯 Repository goals

Build a solid foundation in electronics and embedded systems

Serve as a learning log and technical progress record

Act as a base for future projects in robotics, automation, and IoT

Each folder represents an independent experiment or project, with simple, readable code, prioritizing clarity over premature optimization.
